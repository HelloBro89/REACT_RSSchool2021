# New app

## &nbsp;&nbsp; This application is used for keyword searches. In the SEARCH field, enter a word or several keywords and click SEARCH. You can also sort the found material by relevance, popularity and publication date. Below you can enter the page number of the result in the search output.

&nbsp;&nbsp; _Unfortunately, if you run this application from a non-local server, most of the functionality will not work. This is due to the policy of the third-party API service used here._
